To compile and test this library (assuming you are compiling for bullet):

put this directory in a location accessable from PYTHONPATH.

cd to this directory then run:

$ make

then symlink your libpal_bullet.so file into libs, mine would be:

$ ln -s /usr/lib/libpal_bullet.so libs/libpal_bullet.so

then run:

$ python tests/testall.py

This will run the unit tests.
